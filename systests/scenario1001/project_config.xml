<!-- 
     An example of an evaluation of single-valued, operational flow forecasts applying a time
     series metric, such as time-to-peak-error.  Such evaluations are inherently different than
     other evaluations which most often yield results per lead time or other temporal pooling
     window.  In this case, the forecast time series is treated as a whole, the peak identified,
     the time to peak computed, and that value compared against an equivalent computation based
     on observations.

             Thresholds are used to restrict the range of outputs for which timing 
             errors will be computed. Here, the thresholds will select those portions of 
             the paired time series whose "left and right" (i.e. observed and forecast)
             values are "greater than" 183 CMS and, separately, are greater than 184 
             CMS. Thus, three sets of results should be expected, one for all data,
             which is the default threshold, and one for each of the prescribed 
             thresholds of 183 CMS and 184 CMS. The measurement units are defined 
             in the "unit" declaration, above.

             A timeSeriesMetric is a metric that operates on a time-ordered list of
             pairs, i.e. a paired time series. Currently, timeSeriesMetric are defined
             separately from regular metric, because they require a time-ordered list
             of pairs. For this reason, instances of timeSeriesMetric cannot be mixed
             with regular metric (each declaration must include one or the other). 
             The "time to peak error" is one example of a timeSeriesMetric. It measures 
             the duration, in decimal hours, between the "left" or observed peak value 
             and the "right" or forecast peak value (right minus left). A negative value 
             indicates that the right/predicted value occurs too early. There is one
             time to peak error for each paired time series. Additionally, summary 
             statistics may be computed from the collection of errors. For example, 
             if there are ten paired time series, there will be ten time to peak errors,
             and these errors may be summarized with a mean or a median (etc.). The
             required summary statistics are declared as summaryStatistics.

             This is another example of a timeSeriesMetric. In this case, each
             timing error is expressed as a fraction of the duration between
             the start of the paired time-series and the time of the observed
             peak. Thus, emphasis is placed on large timing errors that occur 
             at early forecast lead times, rather than small timing errors that
             occur at late forecast lead times.
