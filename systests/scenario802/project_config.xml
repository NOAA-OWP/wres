<!-- An example of an evaluation of ensemble, operational stage forecasts using two types of 
     thresholds: stage thresholds in a JSON file and probability classifier thresholds
     specified within this configuration.  The evaluation is of the 4-day maximums (peak
     stages) between the lead times of 2 days and 6 days.
