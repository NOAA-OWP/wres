<!-- This is a test of real, HEFS baseline validation streamflow data verified through WRES 
     where the observations are 24h mean streamflow (QME) provided in a PI-timeseries XML 
     file and the HEFS ensemble forecasts are of 6h instantaneous stream flow (QINE) 
     provided in a gzipped tarball.  The HEFS forecasts are compared against ESP forecasts
     of the same variable allowing for the computation of skill scores; they are also 
     provided in a gzipped tarball.  The evaluation includes temporal rescaling of the 
     forecast data and the computation of a temporal offset (due to time zones) in order to 
     align the forecasts and observations. -->
