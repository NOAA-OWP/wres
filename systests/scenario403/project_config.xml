<!-- An example of an evaluation of single-valued, operational stream flow forecasts against
     observations provided in an NWSRFS datacard file.  It includes a comparison against 
     persistence forecasts generated from the same datacard observations.  The evaluation is 
     performed at a 24-hour, mean desired time scale with lead times pooled into windows that
     are adjacent, non-overlapping, and 24-hours in width.  More details are proivded below.

             additional option not shown here is the pattern, which will allow for only files 
             matching a file name pattern to be processed.  It uses GLOB format, described
             at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming).  For example, 
             'pattern="**/*.xml"' will match any file with the file extension .xml.
