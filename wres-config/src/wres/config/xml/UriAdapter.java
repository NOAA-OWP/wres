/**
 * Converts text from xml tag into a URI, or null if it cannot be converted.
 *
 * Automatically replaces backslashes with slashes for convenience on Windows.
 *
 * The exception generated during unmarshal should be converted to a
 * ValidationEvent that is reported after full unmarshal. This does in fact
 * happen, but the location of the issue is lost and reported as line -1 and
 * column -1. The previous solution (using URI.create in the .xjb file) was
 * somewhat less human-written code, and therefore simpler, but the convenience
 * of replacing backslashes with slashes may make this class worthwhile. If it
 * is not worthwhile, feel free to remove this class.
