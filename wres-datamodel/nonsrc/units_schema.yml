    title: "A mapping between informal units and formal units within the Unified 
    Code for Units of Measure (UCUM)."
    description: "A mapping between the informal units that a user wants the 
    WRES software to recognize by default and a formal unit that is actually 
    understood by WRES within the framework of the UCUM, as described here: 
    https://ucum.org/ucum. Allowing the WRES to understand a unit conveys 
    several important advantages, such as the ability to perform unit 
    transformations. Indeed, where a unit transformation is required, the unit 
    must be understood as a formal UCUM unit. The mapping contained here 
    satisfies two goals. First, it allows for backwards compatibility with 
    versions of WRES prior to 5.14, which contained a hard-coded list of 
    supported (informal) units. Second, it allows a user to expand the list of 
    informal units that are commonly used across their evaluations without 
    adding an explicit unit alias (i.e., a mapping between an informal and a 
    formal unit) to each evaluation. The order of the mapping is informal unit 
    (left side or key) to formal unit (right side or value)."
