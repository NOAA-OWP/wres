# What is this?

This bin directory is hopefully temporary.

It is a place for a pre-compiled RHEL7/CentOS7-compatible flatc binary.

The flatc binary is a flatbuffers compiler, akin to protoc.

The binaries provided by a generous person via The Central Repository
use a later version of glibc than is available in RHEL7/CentOS7.

So until a switch to RHEL8 or other non-ancient OS, this is needed.

Conversely, if there are no systems using CentOS7 anymore, this is
no longer needed and can be deleted.

The same is true for RHEL6/CentOS6.
