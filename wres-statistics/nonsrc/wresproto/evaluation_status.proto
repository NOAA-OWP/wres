    message to an Evaluation message. It is assumed that this identifier is 
    packaged with the protocol; it is not provided inband. An EvaluationStatus 
    message may record some or all of the EvaluationStatusEvent associated with 
    an evaluation at the point of request. For example, it may record only those 
    "new" events surfaced since the last request. Publishers and subscribers 
    also report on their status, in order to allow for evaluations to be 
    completed, validated as complete, and resources returned. A publisher 
    reports when publication is complete and a consumer reports when consumption 
    has started and completed. A consumer registers and reports with a consumer 
    identifier in the protocol metadata. Once an evaluation reports publication 
    complete and all consumers report consumption complete, then the evaluation 
    itself can complete.*/
