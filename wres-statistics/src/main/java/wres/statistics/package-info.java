/**
 * <p>This package provides a canonical representation of statistics for use by other WRES packages and downstream 
 * applications and services. The Java sources are generated from Protocol Buffers (aka protobufs) whose schema is 
 * contained in .proto files within this package. The POJOs generated from these bindings should be considered 
 * "dumb data"; that is, objects without behavior. Indeed, the wres-datamodel wraps these objects and adds behavior.
 * 
 * <p>For more information on Protocol Buffers, see: https://protobuf.dev/
