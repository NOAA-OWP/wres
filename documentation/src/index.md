# Water Resources Evaluation Service

This document is for power users of WRES: those who wish to run WRES locally
rather than use the WRES NWCAL instance HTTP API service.

## Prerequisites

1. Java 11 runtime environment
2. Access to Postgres 10+ database instance for larger-than-RAM deployments, or
   alternatively RAM sufficient to hold the datasets for one evaluation.

## Set up the database

Skip this step if not using postgresql.

To use postgresql, ask the software development team to help with this.

## Run the software

Ensure that the database you wish to connect to is specified in this file:

        lib/conf/wresconfig.xml

For in-RAM (no postgresql) use the example H2 string found in this document.

### Unix systems

        bin/wres execute /path/to/project.xml

### Windows systems

        bin\wres.bat execute c:/path/to/project.xml

This will run an evaluation project configuration specified in "project.xml"
from start to finish.

You may run the wres script from inside the build/install/wres or unzipped project, and the project file may be in any
location or any file name, absolute or relative.

### Optional

Standard java parameters you wish to pass in for troubleshooting can be set in
JAVA_OPTS. Additionally, a system property named wres.logLevel will set the
amount of logging that occurs during a run. As an example, to increase verbosity
to the debug level:

#### Unix

        JAVA_OPTS="-Dwres.logLevel=debug" bin/wres execute project.xml

#### Windows

        set JAVA_OPTS="-Dwres.logLevel=debug" && bin\wres.bat execute project.xml

### Viewing log files

Messages will be printed to standard out during execution and also written
with more detail to a directory inside your user home directory. By default,
the total size of this directory will be trimmed daily to a couple hundred megs.

Also by default, the log file name includes the date.

#### Unix

        cat $HOME/wres_logs/wres.[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD].log

#### Windows

        type %USERPROFILE%\wres_logs\wres.[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD].log
