// This build.gradle is released along with gradle wrapper inside a separate
// integration tests zip. The idea is to defer or make optional the run of
// these integration tests that rely on external services, to better
// distinguish these tests from WRES system tests, because these are only
// partially testing WRES functionality, mostly testing service availability
// and external service API changes. Unlike the systests distribution that
// requires an argument of which WRES version to test, this distribution has
// everything it needs to run. It will update when there are newer versions
// of the jars at WRES build time. So this should be self-contained, just
// run it.

// In order to get the test framework software (e.g. junit):
