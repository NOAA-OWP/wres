/**
 * <p>
 * Identifies a scoring rule that operates on probabilistic inputs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Propriety is an important attribute of scores over probabilistic predictions, and indicates whether there is scope to
 * "hedge" by issuing predictions that deviate from the expected outcome, simply to maximize the score. Since hedging is
 * undesirable (it encourages predictions that are untruthful), scores that cannot be hedged are preferred. These are
 * known as "proper" scores when the expected score is optimized by issuing a truthful prediction and "strictly proper"
 * when the optimal score is <b>uniquely</b> achieved for the truthful prediction. For further details, see:

 * Gneiting, T. and Raftery, A.E. (2007) Strictly proper scoring rules: prediction and estimation. <i>Journal of the
 * American Statistical Association</i>, <b>102</b>(477), 359-378.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The propriety of a scoring rule is not guaranteed, and an otherwise proper scoring rule may be hedged for a subset of
 * data. For example, when conditioning on observed amount, a proper scoring rule will favour models that overestimate
 * large observations, otherwise known as the "forecaster's dilemma" (see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09244v1).
