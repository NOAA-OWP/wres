/* Combination of certificate-based authentication for the management console 
   and no/guest authentication for the messaging. The outer name, activemq-cert, 
   must correspond to the hawtio.realm Java system property. The certificate 
   login has a JAAS designation of sufficient and the guest login module has a 
   designation of optional. This is further explained in the 
   javax.security.auth.login.Configuration class. When securing the messaging 
   transports with TLS, the certificate login module should move to required and 
   the guest login module should be removed. */
