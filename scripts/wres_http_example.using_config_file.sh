# The WRES HTTP API uses secured HTTP, aka HTTPS, which is a form of TLS aka
# Transport Layer Security, which relies on X.509 certificates for
# authentication. In this case, the server is providing authentication to the
# client, saying "I am so-and-so". For the client to trust the server, the
# client needs to have pre-arranged trust of the certificate that the server
# will send, or trust of the certificate that signed the certificate that the
# server will send. When making client requests to the server, we instruct the
# client to trust a ca for this request explicitly, referencing a file that
# contains the certificate of the server. The file may be retrieved at
# https://***REMOVED***/redmine/projects/wres-user-support/wiki/Import_Certificate_Authority_in_Browser_for_Access_to_WRES_Web_Front-End

# By POSTing an evaluation project configuration, we are requesting the
# creation of a resource (in this case, an evaluation job) on the server.
# The server will create the resource and we can GET information about the job.
# We furthermore want to save the server's response to the POST, because it
# contains the name of the created resource in its response. We use post_result.
# The tr -d is to remove carriage return characters from the response.

# More details about above follow. The -i option of curl causes response headers
# to be returned. The --cacert option of curl specifies the Certificate
# Authority to trust for this request (see above). The --data option of curl
# causes a POST to be performed rather than the default GET, inside which are
# the parameters and values to POST.

# We check whether the POST was successful by looking for HTTP code 200 or
# 201, something in the 2xx series.
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success for
